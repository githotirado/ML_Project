                <h3>Participant Demographics</h3>
                Participants in the research had to provide consent to let their responses be used in the data set.  
                More introverts than the other two groups both participated in the study and gave their consent, despite 
                the general consensus that extroverts outnumber introverts by 3 to 1.
              </p>
              <p>
                The age group of participants was mostly GenZ followed by Millenials, and more females participated than males. 
                We excluded demographic data from the training and testing of our model because the distribution of participants 
                did not mirror the population demographics of the world.  For example, the researchers used a responder's IP address 
                to determine the countries where the questionnaires were responded; this metric as well did not reflect 
                the population distribution of those countries.  Observe the dashboard of responder demographics:

                <p>The overall distribution chart is based on how participants identified themselves.  Since we know that in general 
                  extroverts outnumber introverts by 3 to 1, we might surmise that introverts are more inclined to participate in these 
                  research projects than extroverts.  As a result, fewer samples were available from extroverts to improve accuracy for 
                  identifying extroverts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The countries list displays the electronic location of the participants.  With the US, Great Britain, and Canada comprising 
                  the top 3 participant countries, it would be safe to assume that we should not use country data to train our model since 
                  this distribution does not adequately represent the true population distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the age and gender distributions show that mostly female and mostly GenZ people participated in the research.  For 
                  all distributions, self-identified introverts were the largest participation groups.

                  <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                  The <b>Confusion Matrix</b> proved to be telling about the model's ability to predict the three personality 
                  traits.  The model had the most success with predicting introverts, which was the largest group of participants.  
                  There were fewer self-identified extroverts in the data set to help us train the model to predict them.  The largest 
                  group to contain false predictions was the ambivert group.  This might be attributable to ambiverts 
                  with introvert functions and ambiverts with extrovert functions.  The questionnaire only offered 3 choices for self 
                  identification.  For example:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      (Count=330) Where the participant identified as ambivert but was predicted to be introvert.  This 
                      might be the group in our Personality Continuum Scale as those ambiverts with introvert functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      (Count=108) Where the participant identified as extrovert but was predicted to be ambivert.  This 
                      might be the group in our Personality Continuum Scale as those ambiverts with extrovert funtions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>   
                </p>

                <h3>Question Responses</h3>
                Some questions produced stronger responses than others for each trait. Introverts favor 1 on 1 interactions 
                and spending time with their hobbies and prefer listening to people in conversations. Extroverts admitted 
                they love to laugh a lot, stand up for themselves, love excitement, and have strong personalities. Ambiverts 
                were neutral for most questions but were in strong agreement to loving excitement and laughing a lot.
