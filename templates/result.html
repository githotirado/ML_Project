      <h3>Ambivert: Introversion/extroversion isn't an all-or-nothing trait; it's actually a 
        continuum and some people might be very extroverted while others are less so.  An 
        ambivert is a person who shows characteristics of both extroversion and introversion.  
        In other words, they fall somewhere in the middle of the scale.  People who are ambiverts 
        are said to be moderately comfortable in social situations but also enjoy some solitary 
        time.</h3>

    <div id="introvert-text" style="display: none;">
      <h3>Introvert: Introverts may prefer taking part in less stimulating activities
         and get pleasure from activities such as reading, writing or meditating.  
         Introverts typically prefer to concentrate on a single activity, analyze situations 
         carefully and take time to think more before they speak.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="extrovert-text" style="display: none;">
      <h3>Extrovert: Extroverts usually prefer to seek out as much social interaction as 
        possible because this is how they feel more energized.  According to estimates, 
        extroverts outnumber introverts by about three to one (Cain, 2012).</h3>
